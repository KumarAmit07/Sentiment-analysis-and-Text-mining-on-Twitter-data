# Sentiment-analysis-and-Text-mining-on-Twitter-data
I have done Sentiment Analysis with twitter data using python where I have tried to find Polarity and Subjectivity of the tweets.    I have also done Text Mining of twitter data using R where I have tried to find how different words are connected and what words are prominent and then done visualization using Word graph.
